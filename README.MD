# Portfolio

## Background

As I went for my first job hunt as a junior web developer, I were in need of a portfolio, and this is it.

## Purpose

To show what types of project I've worked on in the past, of what I've done and know. This portfolio is thus a comilation of the major points as well as other porject I beleive is worth showing.

This is mainly just a passage site to passthrough to other projects.

#### Requirements:

- Decent but simple UI which leads to other project

- If possible, live host projects

- Link to github if repo exists

- Bunch of old porjects

## Development

Decided to store data in a JSON file, just for simplicity sake. 

#### The project includes but is not limited to the following features:

- Simple JS render

- Preview Images

- Desciption with preview of info text which changes title on click

- Links to Github repos

- If avalible, live hosting of project (only during job hunting season)

- General project info
