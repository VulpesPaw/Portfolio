# Portfolio

## Background

As I went on my first job hunt as a junior web developer, I needed a portfolio, and this is it.

## Purpose

To show what types of projects I've worked on in the past, of what I've done and know. This portfolio is thus a compilation of the major points as well as other projects I believe are worth showing.

This is mainly just a passage site to pass through to other projects.

#### Requirements:

- Decent but simple UI which leads to other projects

- If possible, live host projects

- Link to GitHub if repo exists

- Bunch of old projects

## Development

Decided to store data in a JSON file, just for simplicity's sake. 

#### The project includes but is not limited to the following features:

- Simple JS render

- Preview Images

- Description with a preview of info text which changes the title on click

- Links to GitHub repos

- If available, live hosting of projects (only during job hunting season)

- General project info
